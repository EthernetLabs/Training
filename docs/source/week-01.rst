		Week-1 Linux IoT Training
===================================================================

Task - 1: Battery Calculation
-----------------------------

Minimum components required to run a MCU board like Raspberry Pi.

Power consumption for of each component in full working mode.

We have 2500 mAh battery. How many days/hours the battery will take to discharge in full working mode of board.

How to optimize the battery.

How we can convert the 5V into 3.3V. Name that component or IC.

Name a communication device that can be used on the design board.

Task - 2: IEEE-754  Floating Point Standard (Refer: Number_Systems_Exercise.pdf -Question 4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Learn the algorithm that how a floating point is saved.

Code: write a C/C++ code that can present the whole algorithm of IEEE-754. 

`Code for IEEE-754 can be seen or downloaded from github <https://github.com/Ahmer-444/personal-repo/blob/master/IEEE-754.c>`_

Task - 3: CRC & Checksum
-------------------------

Read and Implement CRC and checksums. Why they are used.

Task - 4: Vim Editor
--------------------

Full command on the Vim Editor. Be full aware of all the utilities that we usually use in MS Word in order to manipulate data in a MS file (i.e copy, cut, paste, select, find etc )

Task - 5: Signal Generator & Oscilloscope
-------------------------------------------

Use siggen and xoscope for waveform generation using the sound cards and display it on the screen in bash.

Task - 6: Special Characters
---------------------------

We should be well aware of meanings of special characters in bash/Linux in order of scripting.

Task - 7: BASH HOW TO
----------------------

How to use bash. Bash full command is necessary to move forward in embedded systems.

You can follow Bash How to recent pdf.

#. Redirection (STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR) [0 1 2]
#. Make your own output file descriptor with fd=3. It is used when 1 process writes to a pipe and another process reads to it later on.
#. Pipes are important.
#. Conditional Theory
#. Loops
